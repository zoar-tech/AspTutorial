# AspTutorial

My First Glance on Asp net core An i really want to know more about mvc, 
This is my first tutorial hacking around the tutorial on msdn wesite;
I try my best as much to understand it the code base on ValidateAntiForgeryToken I'm Yet to get Glance on.


For my first time on entity framework core i really think there should be more to it and scalfolding really simplify every corner of the code.
Thanks to Rick Anderson concern the tutorial.
